# EEG_model_WIP
 A WIP model for EEG classification, done for a group project in a Machine Learning course. "inCaseItFitsOnHere.py" is the file with the model; it runs on its own, except for the dataset.
 
 NOTE: This is *not* a finished project; I'm only putting this here so that my group mates can see my code.
