# EEG_model_WIP
 A WIP model for EEG classification, done for a group project in a Machine Learning course
 
 NOTE: This is *not* a finished project; I'm only putting this here so that my group mates can see my code. Also, note that "inCaseItFitsOnHere.py" is the file that works. I am currently unable to figure out why the files which are supposed to be nicer don't work.
